## You don't like your changes

## Push against resistence

## You ammended after pushing to the remote

Git will not let you push after ammending because the ammend changed the commit and it does not match the remote one anymore.
Git hence recommends that you pull first. That is not what you want because you have just changed that last commit with ammend.
You will hence have to force the push.

`$ git push --force-with-lease` \  
This way of forcing the push is preferred over `$ git push -f` because the 
with-lease will check whether there are any additional changes on the remote that you had not fetched yet.
