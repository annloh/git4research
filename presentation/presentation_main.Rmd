## What is git?


![](../img/xkcd_git.png){width=270px} 


---

## Why should I use git?

- Version control
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Transferable skill

---

## How does it work?

- Git manages directories (i.e. folders) on your computer
- These managed folders are called repositories and contain a folder called ".git"
- When you make changes you tell git which changes to include into a snapshot (commit). 
- You will add a small note (commit message) to that snapshot for reference
- You can synchronize your local work with a server (remote)
- You can display changes between snapshots (diff)
- You can get old versions back
- And a lot more

## Git lingo (concepts)
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
- repository (repo)   
- working directory    
- working tree  
- staging area   
- stage 
- commit 

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

</div>

---

## Git lingo (verbs)

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

- branch

- revert   
- tag

</div>

---

## Basic concepts

![](../img/concepts.png){width=800px}

---

## Git/ GitHub workflow

1. Create a **feature branch**
2. Work on that feature (commit)
3. Send a **pull request**
4. Have a colleague **review** the feature
5. **Merge** into master branch

![](../img/workflow.png){width=600px}

---

## Cool stuff 

- Trying out stuff without breaking anything (branching)
- Combining different versions (merging)
- Figuring out who did what (blaming)
- Tracing back your step (searching the log, view diff)
- Marking a specific version (tagging)

--- 

## Really cool stuff

- Rewriting the history (rebasing, resetting)
- Undoing stuff (resetting, reverting)
- Seperating the good from the bad (cherry-picking)

---

## Beginner mistakes to avoid

- Large commits
- Incoherent commits (atomic commits)
- Working on or pushing to the master branch (feature branches)
- Weird commit messages
- Unnecessary files in the repo (.gitignore)
- Cleaning up remotely and keeping the mess locally

---

## What client should I get to use git?

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

**NONE !!!**

</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

### Reasons to use the command line

- Deeper understanding of what is going on
- Independence of GUI availability
- Complex commands might not be implemented in GUI

</div>

---
## Why do people give up on git?

- Lack of understanding of principle concepts
- Frustrated with client but scared of command line
- Lack of collaborator compliance  
- Lack of a suitable work-flow
- Lack of non-software developer ressources

---

## What if my collaborators don't use git?

- Still good for yourself
- Hacks availabe: 
    - overleaf (messy)
    - dropbox (potentially messy)
    - redoc (haven't tried it yet)

## What do I need to get started?

1. Install git
2. Get a github account 
3. Install kdiff3 (mergetool)

## Addendum of issues that came up during the hacky hour:

### What if I did more than one thing and forgot to commit in between?
Submit single lines using git gui:  
(1) Type `git gui` in the command line  
(2) Select the file that should go in the commit.  
(3) Select the lines you want to commit in the editor on the right.  
(4) Right-click on the selected lines and commit selected lines.  
(5) Enter commit message and commit
