# About

This git introduction is meant for researchers.

I asume you use git to version control code for data analysis and manuscript preparation.
You might even want to use git to collaborate on a research project or share your work with others so they can extend what you have done.

Over the past decade I have tried multiple GUIs for git only to find them more confusing than helpful. Hence, this introduction mainly uses git from the command line (Git BASH).

Whereever beneficial the built-in GUI tools gitk and git-gui are used.

Should you prefer point and click options for using git you need to find yourself another tutorial. (Sorry)

Git-hub will be used for anything related to remote repositories, not because I think it is the best but because it is the only platform I am familiar with and the one predominantely used by my scientific community.



## Note

I will be using pointy brackets `<>` to signify that you have to input whatever your files or names are such as: 
`<your name>`, `<filename>` or `<branch name>`. 
The brackets themselves have to be omitted when replacing this placeholder.  

## Disclaimer

This tutorial is an imperfect mix of my private help file, 
git presentations I have given and git related questions I repeatedly encounter
decorated with git related memes and ressources that I have found funny and/or helpful.

Credit for usefulness goes to my amazing husband @ploh who has patiently taught me everything I know about git. Any mistakes in this document are a reflection of my inability to correctly apply the wisdom bestowed upon me.

The github repository corresponding to this tutorial should NOT be used as an example.
Please, do as I say, not as I do ;-)
