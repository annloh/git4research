# Beyond the command line

Making life easier

## gitk
You can open gitk by typing
`gitk --all &`

This will make what you see a little prettier as it sorts by date-order
` gitk --all --date-order &`

This will open a new window with gitk.
The `&` at the end of the line will allow you to keep using the command line while having the gitk window open.
gitk allows you to get a good overview of your repository history. 
Feel free to look around and see what happens if you click certain things.
