# Collaboration Hacks

What if my collaborators can't use git?

## Hack 1: Dropbox (or other cloud storage)

Create a git repository for them in a cloud storage. 
Set the name and emailadress to match the collaborator. 
Create a branch for them to work on and make sure that branch is checked out.

When they are done working send a pull request for their branch. 
Or merely look at the diff and decide what you want to keep. 

*Advantage:* You are in full control of what can be done to that repository since you have full access. 
Should you have found some mistakes you can update your collaborators version.   \  

*Disadvantage:* Potentially messy.

## Hack 2: Overleaf (For latex)

Overleaf can be set up to push to github. 
Furthermore, you can clone the whole project.

*Advantage:* Easy to use.  \

*Disadvantage:* Hideous commit messages. If your collaborator forgets to pull things get really messy.
