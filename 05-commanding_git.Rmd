# Talking to git

Your main way of communicating with git is the command line.
Every interaction with git works in the same way.

1. Determine which repository you are currently working with.
2. Open Git bash in the folder that contains that repository.
3. Tell git what to do.

Step 3 always consists of typing 
`git <verb>` and hitting enter.

Often the verb is followed by more or less obscure other things that specify the way in which git should do the verb.
Examples:  \   

`git commit -m '<commit message>'`  \  
`git add <hallo_world.txt>` \  
`git checkout -b ` \  
`git clean -n`  \  

If you are familiar with the Linux command line these letters will probably make sense to you. 
If you are not you can either live with the fact, that what you are typing makes little obvious sense or read up on it here: <add link to bash intro>

## Getting help

If you forgot the precise command that you wanted to use you can of course google it.
But git also comes with a build in help.

`git help <verb>`
or
`git <verb> --help`

I'd generally recommend to google things until you feel halfway confident 
as the git help is not exactly written for beginners.  

In this introduction we will cover three more ways to interact with git. 
They will be introduced because they make your life easier for certain tasks
plus they give you an additional sense of control by visually confirming what has happend.
