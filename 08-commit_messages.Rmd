# Commits

## What is a commit?

If you decide to commit your staged files git will take a snapshot of the new status and add it to the repository.
This snapshot will come with a unique sha1 hash. 
This unique hash can be used to refer to this snapshot in the future. 
Technically, a *commit* refers to all the file content, plus the history up to that point, plus all the metadata, 
which is represented by the hash created from all of this.
When people taking about the "content of a commit" oder "reverting the commit" what they actually mean are the 
changes introduced by this commit so the diff to the previous commit. 

`git commit`

Opens an editor and lets you enter your commit message
The message should not be longer than 50 character and summarize what the commit does.
This is the first line in the editor.

In a new line more information can be added that provides more details.

The open editor will also show a ton of information preceden by a `#`. 
This information is not part of the commit message.

A shortcut, that lets you enter the commit message in the command line is
`git commit -m "<Add commit message here>"`

### Content of Commit messages
There are a few simple rules that you should follow when writing commit messages

### Styling Commit messages
You can decorate your commit messages with emojis. 
An overview can be found here:

While some emojis are really useful and ease communication others might be less useful
Some fruthermore have a really long definiton which takes up valuable space in the commit message.
If you would like to use emojis in your commit messages decide on a set of icons and their use together with your collaborators.

Here a few ideas of how they can be used:
 
## When to commit?
A difficult decision is at what point to commit.
What amount of changes define a useful set to commit?

First of all the change introduced by a commit should be logical and coherent.
So changing three typos adding a comment and defining a new function is neither logical nor coherent.
These changes should be in different commmits.

On the other hand commiting frequently, i.e. keeping the commits small is beneficial for collaboration 
(less time for others to change stuff creating merge conflics) and also good from a backup perspective.
Furthermore, it is easier to undo small things than large things. 

However, the amount of things changed does not have to be one.
If you, for example, decide to use a different estimator and therefor have to change a lot of code that could still
be a coherent set of changes. "Use estimator abc instead of estimator xyz".
