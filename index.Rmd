# Prerequisites

In this introduction we will be mainly using git from the command line (Git BASH).

Whereever beneficial we will using the built-in GUI tools gitk and git-gui.

git-hub will be used for remote repositories.

Should you prefer point and click options for using git you need to find yourself another tutorial.

### NOTE
I will be using pointy brackets `<>` to signify that you have to input whatever your files or names are such as: 
`<your name>`, `<filename>` or `<branch name>`. 
The brackets themselves have to be omitted when replacing this placeholder.
