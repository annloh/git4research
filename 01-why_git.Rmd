Many people think of Github as a dropbox for code.
While this is relatively far from the truth it is not entirely inacurate.
If so then Github is a dropbox on speed. 

## What is Git?
- distributed version-control system
- most widely used modern version control system in the world
- most recognized and popular approach to contribute to a project
- not just for code but for any text-based projects

## Why use git?
- Version control
- Keep track of how a project evolved
- Undo mistakes
- Maintain alternative versions
- Test new features without breaking anything
- Private Collaboration (within lab or with collaborators)
- Public collaboration (with the research field)
- Decentralized i.e. you don't have to be connected to a server to use git (unlike google docs or overleaf)
- Git encourages the use of a transparant and reviewed workflow

### Examples of common academic text based files that can be tracked with git
- *.txt (Textfiles)   
- *.R    (R File)
- *.Rmd  (R Markdown document)
- *.csv  (Comma delimited value files)
- *.tex  (Latex files)
- *.bib  (Bibliographie files)
- *.sps  (SPSS Analysis files)

---

### Limitations
- Git only works "properly" with text based file-types. 
- Any file can be tracked
- Git weill only be able to display and merge changes with text-based files
- The git history includes copies of all past versions so larger file types blow up your repository 
- Git is not a backup-system (unless you also upload your repository to a remote server) 
- If you deleted a repository it is gone

---

### Caveat
Depending on when you start managing a project as a git repository collaborators or people on the internet can see every single change you have ever made to the file.
This has been used against people in the past. 
There are ways to prevent this. 
- Only upload a close to final version to github  
- Colllaborate on private repositories and create a new public repository once the project is in a presentable state  
- Write a disclaimer in the readme that the amount of project contribution cannot be inferred from the project history.

### Is it for me?
- Do you have several versions of something but no idea what the difference between them is or how they evolved?
- Do you find yourself copying large sections of code to play with it, try something our wihtout breaking what you already accomplished?
- Have you ever changed something in multiple parts of your code only to figure out that that was a bad idea and the first aproach was better?
- Have you ever worked on code with multiple people and have no idea who wrote a specific part?
