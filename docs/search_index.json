I asume you use git to version control code for data analysis and manuscript preparation. You might even want to use git to collaborate on a research project or share your work with others so they can extend what you have done. Over the past decade I have tried multiple GUIs for git only to find them more confusing than helpful. Hence, this introduction mainly uses git from the command line (Git BASH). Whereever beneficial the built-in GUI tools gitk and git-gui are used. Should you prefer point and click options for using git you need to find yourself another tutorial.

The brackets themselves have to be omitted when replacing this placeholder. 1.2 Disclaimer This tutorial is an imperfect mix of my private help file, git presentations I have given and git related questions I repeatedly encounter decorated with git related memes and ressources that I have found funny and/or helpful. Credit for usefulness goes to my amazing husband (???) who has patiently taught me everything I know about git. Any mistakes in this document are a reflection of my inability to correctly apply the wisdom bestowed upon me. The github repository corresponding to this tutorial should NOT be used as an example. Please, do as I say, not as I do ;-) "]
