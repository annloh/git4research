#Git workflow

##Feature branches


##Pull requests
When you have done some work on a feature branch and would like to incorporate those changes into the master brach it is good practice to send a pull request (rather then push to teh master branch).
A pull request is a message that lets your collaborators now that a substancial part is ready and can be reviewed. 
This can initiate a conversation about the suggested changes. More on pull requests here:

##Tipps to make life with git easier
- submit frequently
- keep lines short (i.e. less than 80 characters when coding, one sentence when wiring in latex)
