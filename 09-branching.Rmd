# Branching

## Creating a new branch
`$ git branch <new branch>`
creates a new branch but does not check it out (i.e. does not switch to it)


Create a new branch and imediately check it out
`$ git checkout -b <new-branch>`

This will get you a new local branch. 
It is however not automatically availible on the remote.
This can be acchieved as following:

`$ git push origin <new-branch>`


## Switching branches
`git checkout <branchname you want to work on>`

Creating a new branch locally does not result in the remote having the same branch (and the other way around).

## Fetching changes after pull request

`$ git fetch --prune`
Deletes references to remote branches which have been deleted on the server


`$ git merge --ff-only`
Gives a warning if the merge is not a fast-forward merge and does not go through with it

`$ git merge --no-ff`
Does fast-forward but creates a merge commit
