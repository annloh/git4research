# Git =/= Github

I hear a lot of people using the terms git and github exchagably. 
Many want to learn how to use github to share their code online with other researchers.
Sharing code online is only a fraction of what github can do and was designed to do. 
Git is a powerful tool that is completely independent of github. 
It is a little like sending people DMs on facebook.
Yes, you can share code on github and you can DM people on facebook but equating the DM function to facebook would mean you are missing out on a lot of features
plus it is not the key feature of facebook.

The core function of git is version control and code management. You can do that locally (i.e. on your own computer) or remotely (i.e. on a server).
Github is a provider that hosts your git controlled projects remotely.  
It offers you everything git has to offer plus some extra features for collaboration and access control.
There are other provoders that offer similar services such as gitlab and bitbucket.
