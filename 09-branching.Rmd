## Creating a new branch
`$ git branch <new branch>`
creates a new branch but does not check it out (i.e. does not switch to it)


Create a new branch and imediately check it out
`$ git checkout -b <new-branch>`

This will get you a new local branch. 
It is however not automatically availible on the remote.
This can be acchieved as following:

`$ git push origin <new-branch>`


## Switching branches

To continue working on a different bracnch you have to switch branches by checking out the branch you would like to work on.  \  

`$ git checkout <branchname you want to work on>`

Careful! As always with checking out, make sure to stage or stash your changes, 
otherwise you lose work.

Creating a new branch locally does not result in the remote having the same branch (and the other way around).


## Fetching changes after pull request

`$ git fetch --prune`
Deletes references to remote branches which have been deleted on the server
