# Getting started

## Installing git
You will need to install git. 
How to do this is explained here:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git


##Initial setup
After the installation there are a few customizations that only have to be done once (well once on every computer you work with). 
They involve telling git your name, your e-mailaddress, your favourite text editor and linking to your git-hub account.
If you are planning on collaborating with people who use a different operating system than you, 
it is wise to also tell git how to handle line endings.

### Setting the configuration information

Rightclick anywhere in a filebrowser and click
"Git BASH HERE"

This will open a command line where you will have to enter the following information:

`$ git config --global user.name "<Your name>"`

`$ git config --global user.email "<your email address>"`

The editor to change commit messages is usually whatever you have as a default associated to `.txt` files
you can change it like this
`$ git config --global core.editor "<name of my favourite editor>"`

Instead of `--global` you can use `--local` for a repository or `--system` for your computer only. 
This might make sense when you might be commititing changes under an alias e.g. for a collaborator who can't use git 
(see section xyx for more details).

Alternatively open git gui by typing 
`$ git gui` in the command line

GitGUI will open click the tab "Edit" and then "Options"

How to prevent git from demanding your GitHub user name and password all the time can be read here:  
https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

There are a few more options that are smart to set. 

You can open the config file in an editor like this:  
`$ git config --global -e --edit`


###Prevent problems with line ending (important for collaboration across operating systems)
transforms windows line endings into linux line endings upon adding
CRLF = Windows line endings
LF = unix and mac line endings

`git config --global core.autocrlf input`
