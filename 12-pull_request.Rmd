# Pull requests

A pull request (which should actually be called a merge request) is a commit that a collaborator
suggests should be merged.

Git-hub offers special features for pull requests that make it easy to review and annotate the suggested code changes.

It is possible to add additional commits to a oull request if it has not been accepted yet.
