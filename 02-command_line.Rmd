# The command line
The command line (aka Git BASH or console) is how we tell git what to do. 
If you are familiar with using a command line in LINUX this one will be just the same. 
You can change directories, list files and so on.

In this into I will not assume that you have any knowlege of how to use the commandline 
(i.e. change directories and such) so we will always open it right in the folder we want to use it.


## Open Git BASH
Use your file explorer to navigate to the folder you want to version control with git.

Rightclick anywhere in a filebrowser and click
"Git BASH HERE"

This will open a command line where you will have to enter the the commands that you find in this introduction.

## General notes regarding the commad line

The following should be kept in mind when usind the command line to not go completely crazy in the process:
- Capitalization matters  
- Spacing matters  
- Some shortcuts like `Ctrl+c` or `Ctrl+v` won't work. You can use the right mouse key instead  
- The tab key is your best friend as it will auto-complete or partially autocomplete anything for you 
which greatly reduces the risk for typos  
- The up-key is your second best friend. Pressing the up-key will automatically input the last command used.   
This is especially useful if you got an error and just need to slightly adjust the previous input.  

## Other useful command line knowledge:

`touch filename.txt`  creates a file

`&` at the end of a line will make sure you can keep using the command line without closing whatever you opened
