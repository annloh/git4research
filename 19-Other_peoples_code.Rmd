#Other peoples code

You have found something on github (or elsewhere on the internet) and would like to use it as a template? Great!  
Answer the following questions to ensure proper acknowledgement of your sources:

###Are you improving a product and would the original author benefir from your improvements?
**Fork** the repository. You will know have a replica of the original (same name, complete history). However, this is now your personal copy. 
It will show the original authors as contributors and everyone can see when and where you started modifying the original. As git still knows
the original history you can make changes to the repository and send a pull request to the original authors inviting them to incorporate your changes.
See here for more info on that:  
https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork


###Are you just stealing some code to get you started?
**Download** the files and start your own repository. The complete history is now gone. It is not apparent that other people have been working on this in the past.  
For reasons of transparency and acknowledgement do the following: 
In your initial commit message add the url from where you got the code and the 
sha-1 hash which indicates the exact commit that served as the source. You can additionally mention the source in the README.Md.
Saving the hash of the original source also allowes you to obtain updates that the original author might add in the future. 
(We will not cover how to do this in this intro.)
